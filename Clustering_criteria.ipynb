    "An example of internal validation is the silhouette score, a way to measure how well each observation is clustered. The silhouette plot shows the relative size of the clusters, the average silhouette score, and whether observations may have been clustered incorrectly. The red line in the graph below indicates the average silhouette score for six clusters: about 0.45 (with 1 being perfect, 0.45 is not a great score)."
